minimum wish list:

- call web scraper every hour
- package into an installable wheel
- install locally and test
- choose hosting provider (Digital Ocean won the contest)
- create a droplet, install postgresql, install my package
- CI/CD
- run coverage on pre-commit (???) abort commit if at least one test failed



DONE
      1. add pyproject.toml
      2. install setuptools
      3. build wheel
      4. install my package with -e and see who it works
      5. cp my wheel to the remote machine && install && run


ISSUES after the wheel been installed and run:
    1. data source blocks IP address -> no data has been mined
POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
    1. use a forward proxy
    2. rotate IP if necessary



Let's dive into Web Scraping rules:
    1. https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/
    2. https://docs.apify.com/academy/web-scraping-for-beginners

Let's learn some more about proxies:
    1. https://research.aimultiple.com/proxy-server-types/

Before byuing proxy, let's try some free options and see who (if) they work:
    1. try free proxy
    2. there's some free open source proxy. what does it offer?

If free proxy hasn't worked, buy some proxy and make it work already:
    1. choose proxy
    2. buy proxy
    3. apply proxy
Proxy hasn't helped

An option that might be worth trying out:
    1. take a web server in Japan
    2. open an ssh tunnel between my droplet and the server in Japan

Write minimum but sufficient unit tests:
    1. cover utils for simple starters
    2. define critical fragile parts and cover them if possible
    3. run tests on pre-commit hooks (Until there's no CI/CD pipeline)


ALWAYS run script behind VPN while on localhost
If IP gets blocked, introduce intervals

SOLID refactoring:
 - single responsibility principle :: ScraperService :: no direct calls to DBService

 Order of tasks:
 1. commit try/except DONE
 2. commit single responsibility principle refactoring DONE
 3. add support of "for sell" deals DONE
 4. add support of "house" and "room" DONE
 5. parallel execution DONE (the simplest form)
 6. clean the code a bit
 7. add unit tests
 8. linter fails to catch typos in methods names. why? BUG
